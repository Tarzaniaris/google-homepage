For this project I have to deconstruct a web page and rebuild it.

No worries if:
1) The links don't go anywhere
2) The search box doesn't work

The goal for this project is to start thinking about how elements:
1) Get placed on the page
2) Get styled
3) Get aligned


!Remember to use the browser's developer tools!
